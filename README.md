# EDA: Fatal Police Shootings in the US

In recent years, particularly since the case of George Floyd in Minneapolis, 25 May 2020, Police Brutality has become a hot button issue in the United States. The number of homicides committed by police in the United States is often compared to those in countries such as England, where the number is significantly lower
You as a Data Scientist is required to analyze the dataset of Fatal Police Shootings maintained by The Washington Post to analyze how biased the shootings are by race or state

**Dataset Description**:

The Washington Post is compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 2015.
In 2015, The Post began tracking more than a dozen details about each killing — including the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by culling local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media and by monitoring independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters. The Post conducted additional reporting in many cases.

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- id - Unique ID

- date - Date of the Shootout
- manner of death - Manner of Death i.e., Shot or Shot & Tasered
- armed - Arm
- age - Age of the Victim
- gender - Gender
- race - Race of the Victim
 -  W: White, non-Hispanic 
 -  B: Black, non-Hispanic 
 -  A: Asian 
 -  N: Native American 
 -  H: Hispanic 
 -  O: Other 
- city - City in which the Shootout happened
- state - State in which the Shootout happened
- signs of mental illness - Boolean Value. Whether the victim had any signs of mental illness during the shootout
- threat_level - Threat Level posed by the victim
- flee - Whether the victim tried to flee during the shootout
- body_camera - Boolean Value. Whether the Police Officer's were wearing body_camera during the shootout
